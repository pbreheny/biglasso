`biglasso` extends lasso and elastic-net model fitting for ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte 
data sets that cannot be loaded into memory. It utilizes memory-mapped files to store the massive data on the disk and only read those into memory whenever necessary during model fitting. Moreover, some advanced feature screening rules are proposed and implemented to accelerate the model fitting. As a result, this package is much more memory- and computation-efficient as compared to existing lasso-fitting packages such as [glmnet](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmnet) and [ncvreg](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncvreg), thus allowing for very powerful big data analysis even with only an ordinary laptop.


## Features:
1. It utilizes memory-mapping files to store the massive data on the disk and only reads those into memory whenever necessary during model fitting, thus can easily handle data-larger-than-RAM cases.
2. It builds upon the pathwise coordinate descent algorithm combined with "warm start", "active set cycling", and feature screening strategies, which has been proved to be one of the most powerful lasso solvers.
3. It incorporates some efficient feature screening rules, such as the sequential strong rule (SSR), the sequential EDPP rule (SEDPP), and our newly proposed and more powerful rules - SSR-Dome and SSR-BEDPP.  
4. The underlying algorithm is implemented in C++ and is optimized to be memory- and computation-efficient. Parallel computing via OpenMP is also supported.


## Benchmarks:

### Simulated data:

* **Packages** to be compared: `biglasso (1.2-3)`, `glmnet (2.0-5)`, `ncvreg (3.7-0)`, and `picasso (0.5-4)`. 
* **Platform**: MacBook Pro with Intel Core i7 @ 2.3 GHz with 16 GB RAM.
* **Experiments**: solving lasso-penalized linear regression over the entire path of 100 $\lambda$ values equally spaced on the scale of `lambda / lambda_max` from 0.1 to 1; varying number of observations `n` and number of features `p`; 20 replications, the mean (SE) computing time (in seconds) are reported.
* **Data generating model**: `y =  X *  beta + 0.1 eps`, where `X` and `eps` are i.i.d. sampled from `N(0, 1)`.
