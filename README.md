# Big Lasso: Extending Lasso Model Fitting to Big Data in R

`biglasso` Extend lasso and elastic-net model fitting for ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte 
data sets that cannot be loaded into memory. Compared to existing lasso-fitting packages, 
it preserves equivalently fast computation speed but is much more memory-efficient, 
thus allowing for very powerful big data analysis even with only a single laptop.

### To install:
* the stable version: `install.packages("biglasso")`
* the latest version (requires devtools): `install_github("YaohuiZeng/biglasso")`
