1.1-2 (9/1/2016)
  * fixed bug occurred when some features have identical values for different 
    observations. These features will be internally removed from model fitting.

1.1-1 (8/31/2016)
  ** Three sparse screening rules (HSR, EDPP, HSR-Dome) were implemented. Our 
	   new proposed HSR-Dome combines HSR and Dome test for feature screening, 
	   leading to even better performance as compared to 'glmnet'.	
  ** OpenMP parallel computing was added to speedup single model fitting.
  ** Both exact Newton and majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for logistic
	   regression were implemented. The latter could be faster, especially in 
	   data-larger-than-RAM cases.
  ** Source code were rewritten in pure cpp.
  *  Sparse matrix representation was added using Armadillo library.
