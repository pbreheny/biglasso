Title: Big Lasso: Extending Lasso Model Fitting to Big Data in R
Author: Yaohui Zeng [aut,cre], Patrick Breheny [ctb]
Maintainer: Yaohui Zeng <yaohui-zeng@uiowa.edu>
Description: Extend lasso and elastic-net model fitting for ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte data sets that cannot be loaded into memory. It's much more memory- and computation-efficient as compared to existing lasso-fitting packages like "glmnet" and "ncvreg", allowing for very powerful big data analysis even with an ordinary laptop.
